This iOS app focuses on reducing community food waste. According to theÂ Wellbeing International Organization, 32.6 millions of tons of food ends up in landfills in the US. The tech stack consists of Swift, SwiftUI, and Firebase and makes use of the model-view-controller design pattern.

Users can upload their food items to the app (information to upload includes a picture, item name, and the expiry date). If a user opts-in for notifications, the app will send a notification on the date of expiry. Users can track their ingredients/food on the "Refrigerator" page of the app. We plan to add a ML component so upon uploading a picture, the app will recognize and label what the ingredient/item is to reduce the manual components of the app.

The app also includes a community page, serving as a social media platform for users to post about surplus ingredients/foods they can share with other nearby users. Users are also able to share recipes of dishes they created. The app currently includes a sample UI page for these features.
